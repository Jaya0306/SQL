Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
 

Write a solution to report all the duplicate emails. Note that it's guaranteed that the email field is not NULL.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
+----+---------+
| id | email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
Output: 
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
Explanation: a@b.com is repeated two times.

Solution:

MySQL

SELECT Email 
FROM Person
GROUP BY email
HAVING count(email) > 1

Pandas

def duplicate_emails(person: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
  email_counts = person.groupby('email').size().reset_index(name='count')

  result = email_counts[email_counts['count'] > 1]

  return result[['email']].rename(columns = {'email':'Email'}).reset_index(drop = True)  

Explanation:

groupby('email'): Groups the rows by the email column.
size(): Counts the number of occurrences for each email.
reset_index(name='count'): Converts the result to a DataFrame with a new column count.
email_counts[email_counts['count'] > 1]: Filters the rows where the count is greater than 1 (i.e., duplicate emails).
rename(columns={'email': 'Email'}): Renames the column to match the required output.

What does reset_index(drop=True) do in Pandas?
reset_index() is used to reset the index of a DataFrame, returning a new index starting from 0. When you pass drop=True, it removes 
the old index rather than adding it as a new column in the DataFrame.

Why use reset_index(drop=True)?
In many cases, after filtering or grouping, the index may be non-sequential or non-meaningful. Using reset_index(drop=True) ensures 
the DataFrame has a clean, sequential index.
